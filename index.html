            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-rose-700" style="font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">My Dearest Hani,</h2>
            <div class="letter-content text-gray-700">
                <p class="mb-4">I've been sad, and most of all, I've been full of regret. I know I've hurt you, and I hate myself for it. I never wanted to make you feel the way you felt angry, confused, or worse, unimportant. That's never how I wanted us to turn out. But I was wrong, and now I must speak not only with my words, but from the very core of me. I'm sorry, hani. I really am.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">I don't know how else to express it but this: I was wrong. I should have listened better. I should have been more patient, kinder with my words, more cautious with my actions. You didn't deserve any of the hurt that I inflicted on you, even if it wasn't meant. And now that we've had time apart or time in silence, I know how much you matter to me. It's not about missing your messages or your presence it's about missing you, the individual who makes my world safe, happy, and alive.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">Relationships aren't perfect. We both know that. We're just two individuals attempting to make sense of each other while navigating our own feelings, past wounds, and everyday stresses. Sometimes we fight, sometimes we misinterpret, and sometimes we say things out of anger that we later regret. But what pains me is that I overstepped the line I let a lapse of anger or carelessness hurt the one person I love the most. That is not love, and I despise that I made you feel uncared about.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">The reality is, I care more than I could ever express. I love you not merely when all is well, not merely in the good times, but even in the mess, the confusion, and the hard days. I love you all of it. And I should have demonstrated that more. I should have been your safe haven, not one who complicated things. I want to be the one that soothes your tempests, not one who stirs them up. And I know I let you down on that.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">I've taken time to reflect on our arguments, what I've said, what I might have done differently. I can't undo what's done, no matter how much I wish I could. But I can own up to it. I can admit to as much as I was in the wrong, and that I hurt you, and that you are perfectly within your rights to feel the way you do. And I'll never tell you to forget what occurred but I am asking for a second chance to make it right. To show you that I'm not a repeat offender here, and I'm happy to grow.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">You've always been kind to me. You've always made an effort to see me, even when I'm being quiet, obstinate, or lost in my own thoughts. You've stood by me in ways that I didn't even realize I needed you to stand by me. And then I let my pride or my anger cause me to fall short of loving you with the same compassion and consideration. Something that I will forever regret. You were better than me, and I owe you better—not verbally, but in my treatment of you from here on out.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">They tell you that you don't appreciate something until you have a chance to lose it, and regretfully, that's true. In this distance, in this silence, I've understood just how much you mean to me. You're not merely my girlfriend you're my best friend, my partner, my safe haven, my happiness. You're the one I want to share good news with first, and the only one I need to have by my side when things fall apart. And the fear of losing you all because of my faults? It's unacceptable.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">I understand sorry isn't enough. I understand that words, no matter how many or heartfelt, can never erase what I said or did. But I also know that love is a choice of forgiveness, patience, and learning. I do believe in us. I do believe in the foundation we've created. I believe that although I harmed you, we can still mend. We can still emerge from this stronger if you'll let me fix it.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">Let me demonstrate to you that I am capable of change not in this relationship's sake, but because I would like to be the man you're worthy of. I would like to be someone you're proud to call yours. Someone who encourages you, not discourages you. I would like to be the sort of partner who selects love over ego, comprehension over ire, and benevolence over pride. I want to be the one who never gets tired of choosing you, even on difficult days.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">And I know that we will have more fights in the years to come. That's just life and love. But I give you this promise: I will do my best to deal with them better. I will listen better, talk quieter, and pay more attention to your heart. I won't hide when things become tough. I will stay, I will fight, and I will choose love again and again.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">There's a reason that I fell for you. It's not merely because of your good looks or your compassion but your heart. You're one who loves hard, forgives easily, and gives more than they receive. And I want to care for that heart, not harm it. I want to be the cause for you to smile, not cry.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">Please believe me when I tell you that you're everything to me. This is not a relationship I take lightly. You're not some chapter in my book you're the story I want to continue writing. And I know I've written some hurtful pages, but I still hope for the better pages yet to come between us. If you let me, I swear I'll make the next chapter one of healing, of love, of hard work.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">If you require time, I get it. If you require space, I will provide it. If you need to scream, to cry, to tell you what is inside your heart, I am here. And I will be here—not waiting but growing. Growing into someone who learns from his errors. Someone who understands that love isn't about words but action. And I'm willing to demonstrate that type of love to you.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">I miss you more than words can say. I miss your voice, your presence, your energy. I miss the way you made me smile, the way you believed in me, even when I did not believe in myself. I miss your random messages, your little jokes, your care. But above all, I miss us the way we were before the fight. And I want that again. I want to rebuild what I destroyed. I want to revive the love that was like home.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">There are nights, I lay awake just thinking about it all. Asking myself if I could have done things differently. Wishing I had bitten my tongue and refrained from speaking with anger, or just breathed before I talked. Sometimes, the ache of regret is the only thing louder than any sound in my head. But amidst all those thoughts is still you—the one being I'd do anything for. The one I'd change for. The one I still think is my person, no matter how terribly I sabotaged us.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">I understand that sorry isn't about being perfect. It's about being honest. And I swear to you I am being utterly honest right now. No filters, no excuses, no blame-shifting. I hurt you, and I'm sorry. I love you, and I want to mend this. If I could turn back time and erase every painful moment I caused you, I would. Since I can't, I will do my best to make the future something we can both be proud of.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">And despite all the uncertainty that is going on right now, I still have hope. Hope that you'll notice how much I care. Hope that you'll notice I'm willing to work not just apologize, but improve. Hope that the love we shared, all those good days and laughs and serious talks, are sufficient to remind you that what we share is real. That even when I messed up, my heart has always belonged to you.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">If I could turn back the clock when I hurt you, I'd stop myself. I'd pick love over ego. I would recall your face, the tone of your voice, and the importance you hold in my life. But I can't turn back. What I can do is start again, with all the determination to heal, to learn, and to be a person that you can trust once more.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">I don't want to lose you to a mistake. I don't want our tale to have a tragic ending because of something that I might have avoided with greater care, more love, more maturity. I know now, which I didn't know back then how valuable love is and how crucial it is to never let it go by unappreciated and I won't do it again.</p>
